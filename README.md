# ARCHS4-Clustering
Clustering code starting from a UW CS 548 final project with the final goal of laying out a code structure to allow easy cluster analysis on the ARCHS4 gene expression database

Follow along in the notebooks folder if this is your first time viewing this code, or use the src code if you know what you're doing.
